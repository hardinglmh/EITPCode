# Exercise 1: Environment Setup for Python

In this exercise, you do the following:
+ Environment Setup for Python on Mac OS
+ Environment Setup for Python on Windows
+ Environment Setup for Python on Google Colab
 
## Environment Setup for Python on Mac OS
Python on a Macintosh running Mac OS X (High Sierra) is in principle very similar to Python on any other Unix platform, but there are a number of additional features such as the IDE and the Package Manager that are worth pointing out.

Mac OS X 10.8 comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed by Apple. If you wish, you are invited to install the most recent version of Python 3 from the Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/). A current “universal binary” build of Python, which runs natively on the Mac’s new Intel and legacy PPC CPU’s, is available there.

1. Go to Python website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).
1. Choose the latest Python release (e.g. Latest Python 3 Release - Python 3.8.3) and click Download [macOS 64-bit installer] (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python-3.8.3-macosx10.9.pkg).
1. Execute the installer until below screen shown.
1. Installation completed. Press Command + Space, type terminal.app to open the text-based terminal.
1. Type python --version to see the installed version of Python on your Mac OS.


## Environment Setup for Python on Windows
Unlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not include a system supported installation of Python.

Python release only supports a Windows platform while Microsoft considers the platform under extended support. This means that Python 3.8 supports Windows Vista and newer. If you require Windows XP support then please install Python 3.4.

1. Go to Python website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
1. Choose the latest Python release (e.g. Latest Python 3 Release - Python 3.8.3), click Download [Windows x86-64 executable installer] (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python-3.8.3-amd64.exe) for 64-bit Windows, or [Windows x86 executable installer] (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python-3.8.3.exe) for 32-bit Windows.

1. Execute the installer.
l. Choose Add Python 3.8 to PATH and click Install Now.
1. Installation completed. Go to Start Menu, choose Folder Python 3.8, click IDLE (Python 3.8 64-bit) to open text-based terminal and start development.


## Environment Setup for Python on Google Colab
Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with
+ Zero configuration required
+ Free access to GPUs
+ Easy sharing

You can improve your Python programming language coding skills, develop deep learning applications using popular libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

The most important feature that distinguishes Colab from other free cloud services is; Colab provides GPU and is totally free.
