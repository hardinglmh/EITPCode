# **Introduction**
This is a collection of Javascript-based (Node.js) and Python-based sample code that interact with the Amazon Lex which is an AWS service for building conversational interfaces into applications using voice and text.

##  Project Description
This toolkit contains sample programs based on Amazon Lex SDK, Node.js and Python 2.7, including ordering flowers, ordering a pizza, booking a hotel and other coming projects.

### Establish Connection  
Amazon Lex provides API operations that you can integrate with your existing applications. You can use any of the following options:
+ AWS Console — The console is the easiest way to get started testing and using Amazon Lex 
+ AWS SDK — When using the SDKs your requests to Amazon Lex are automatically signed and authenticated using the credentials that you provide. This is the recommended choice for building your applications.
+ AWS CLI — You can use the AWS CLI to access any Amazon Lex feature without having to write any code.

Below examples are designed for students to get familiar with Amazon Lex, and we use AWS Console as the development tool.
