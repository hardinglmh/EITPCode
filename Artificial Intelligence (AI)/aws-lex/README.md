# **Introduction**
This is a collection of Javascript-based (Node.js) and Python-based sample code that interact with the Amazon Lex which is an AWS service for building conversational interfaces into applications using voice and text.

##  Project Description
This toolkit contains sample programs based on Amazon Lex SDK, Node.js and Python 2.7, including ordering flowers, ordering a pizza, booking a hotel and other coming projects.

### [Exercise 1 : Order Flowers](ex1.md)
For this exercise, create a bot for ordering flowers by Web Console, called \(`OrderFlowers`\) Bot\.

### [Exercise 2 : Order Pizza](ex2-step1.md)
In this exercise, you use the Amazon Lex console to create a custom bot that orders pizza \(`OrderPizza`\)\. You configure the bot by adding a custom intent \(`OrderPizza`\), defining custom slot types, and defining the slots required to fulfill a pizza order \(pizza crust, size, and so on\)\.
